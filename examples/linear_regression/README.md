# Linear Regression with Particle and TensorFlow Lite

An end-to-end example of the process of creating MCU-friendly models. This example illustrates the complete process including: 

1. Training a simple linear regression model with TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Converting that model to the TensorFlow Lite FlatBuffer format.
3. Converting the TFLite FlatBuffer model to a C byte array.
4. Performing inference with the model on a Particle 3rd Gen device (Xenon) using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers.
5. Displaying the results on a connected TFT Display.

The end result is Machine Learning on an embedded device!
